# cpp-lib

A library of C++ containers for some non-standard data-structures.

They are useful to copy/paste into competitive programming competitions, but are not exactly production quality. If production quality code is needed, the simplicity of these containers will work well as a base that can be expanded upon for any additional requirements and standards.
